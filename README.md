UX QA tooling for the **jankurai** standard: a Playwright and axe wrapper that
emits deterministic, artifact-backed rendered UX proof receipts. This repository
is one member of the Jankurai split family; read [`SPLIT.md`](SPLIT.md) for the
family contract and [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for agent routing rules.

## Stack

Node + TypeScript product surface driving a Playwright/axe rendered UX QA
runtime, with machine-readable JSON Schemas for its report and policy contracts.
New implementation is TypeScript-first; see
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## Quick start

```bash
# One-command setup (install workspace dependencies from the lockfile).
just setup

# Deterministic fast lane (typecheck/build + tests + self-audit).
just fast

# Full local check: format, lint, fast, security, and self-audit.
just check
```

The full command surface lives in the root [`Justfile`](Justfile). Continuous
integration runs the same lanes under
[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).
