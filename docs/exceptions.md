# Agent exceptions and overrides

This document defines the agent-friendly exception pattern for
jankurai-tools-ux: how an agent or maintainer requests, records, and bounds an
override of a standard rule. Exceptions are the only sanctioned way to deviate
from the audit baseline.

## Principle

The default answer is "follow the standard." An exception is a dated, owned,
expiring waiver for a specific rule on a specific path. Exceptions are data, not
prose: they live next to the code they govern and are reviewed on every audit.

## How to request an exception

1. Identify the exact `rule_id` and `path` the exception applies to (from the
   audit JSON `findings[]`).
2. Add an entry to the relevant `agent/*.toml` manifest. For boundary
   reclassifications use `agent/boundaries.toml`; for UX QA policy use
   `agent/ux-qa.toml`; for scan-path exclusions use the `[scan]` block in
   `agent/audit-policy.toml`.
3. Every exception entry MUST carry:
   - `owner` — the team or person accountable.
   - `classification` — e.g. `brownfield`, `temporary`, `vendor`.
   - `expires` — an ISO date after which the exception is invalid and the audit
     fails again.
   - `migration_path` — the concrete plan to remove the exception.

## Example

A temporary boundary reclassification carries a documented exception in
[`agent/boundaries.toml`](../agent/boundaries.toml):

```toml
[[boundary_exception]]
path = "packages/ux-qa/src/storybook.ts"
classification = "temporary"
owner = "ux-qa"
expires = "2026-12-31"
migration_path = "Move Storybook ingestion behind the generated report contract."
```

## Override review

- Every exception is re-evaluated on each `just audit` run.
- An expired exception is treated as a hard finding, not a pass.
- Removing an exception requires deleting its entry and proving the underlying
  rule now passes on its own.

## What is never excepted

Secret leakage, hand-edits to generated zones, and non-deterministic visual
proof (pixel or AI/VLM judgment replacing byte/hash baselines) are never granted
exceptions. Fix the underlying cause instead.
