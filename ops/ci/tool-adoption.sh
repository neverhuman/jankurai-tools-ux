# Tool-adoption evidence lane.

# jankurai replaces a fleet of ad-hoc tools (manual scoring, gitleaks-only
# security, hand-rolled contract/release/cost drift checks) with first-class
# subcommands. This lane runs each adopted command in CI and writes its
# evidence artifact under target/jankurai/ so the audit can prove the
# replacement actually executed. The matching artifacts are uploaded by the
# workflow's actions/upload-artifact step.
